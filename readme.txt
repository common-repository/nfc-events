Allow your customers to create events by scanning NFC tags.

== Description ==
Create unique NFC product tag URLs, custom user roles and NFC pages with custom blocks.
Allow all or specific customers to create events by scanning NFC tags.
Manage NFC events and media within WP dashboard and more.

== Installation ==
= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP 7.4 or greater is recommended
* MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field type “NFC Events,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found the plugin, you can install it by clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with the NFC pages after an update, flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting “Save.” That should return things to normal.
